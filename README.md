# testassessment
A React application that interfaces with the JSONPlaceholder API to facilitate Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on posts.

## Technologies
- React/NextJS
- TailwindCSS

## Features
AnyPost has the following features:
- List all posts
- View a single post
- Create a new post
- Update an existing post
- Delete a post

**Note**: The JSONPlaceholder API simulates CRUD operations, so data changes like creating, updating, or deleting posts won't persist. For the purpose of this demonstration, posts created within the app are stored in React Context to emulate persistence within a session.
